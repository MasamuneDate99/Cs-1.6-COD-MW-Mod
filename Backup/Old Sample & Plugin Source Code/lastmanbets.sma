Idea from miscstats' "Lastman" (by Olo?)


LAST MAN BETS
=============
When two people remain, one on each team, the other players will have the chance to bet a sum of money on who will win the round.
You have to have a minimum of $100 (adjustable through a cvar) to place a bet, but then you can raise your bet as much as your wallet performs.
If your bet wins, you win the other betters money. The more you bet, the more you win. If you win. :-)
Everything is completely menu driven, no need to learn any commands or anything.
Bots bet automatically.

Pots: If no one bets on winning player, all failing bets will be added to the pot. The next player to win a bet (win the most money, if more win the same bet), gets the pot.
If pot is not collected before map ends/server shuts down/crashes ;-) it will be there for next map.

Example: If you bet $200 on the t player, and another person bets $100 on the t player, and the t player wins, you will receive 2/3rds of the total sum of money bet by all players.

Winning over $16000: Win prizes (optional)! For the money you win over $16000, you receive something:

For each		You receive
---------------------------
$1000			Xtra life (respawn as long as round did not end when you died, a note to all players go out that you respawned - and how many lives you have left)
$100			Health boost (+100 health when spawning)
$10				Assault suit (if you don't have 100 armour when spawning, you will be given a full assault suit)



INSTALLATION
============
Before you install as usual, you might want to go through a couple of defines below. See "Adjust below settings to your liking".


USAGE
=====
No commands or anything. Betting is done through menus that pop up...

There are three cvars:
- lastmanbets_overridemenus
Default value is 1. You can set this to 0 so that if a player already has a menu open (amxmodmenu, wc3 menu, etc) the bet menu should not open. Note, from version 0.9 this always overrides VGUI menus due to some bug with detection of those.

- lastmanbets_defaultbet
Default value is 100. This value is the amount of $ needed to be able to place the minimum bet. It also defines the base for increments when raising/lowering bets.

- lastmanbets_bettime
Default value is 20 (seconds). Defines how long time the bet menu will stay open - a timer counts down in center of screen. When it reaches 0 whoever still has the bet menu open will have it closed.


VERSIONS
========
Released	Version		Comment
070820			0.9.4	Added  menu option to bet all money in one go.
050218			0.9.3	Don't respawn as spectator if having extra lives. Thanks "peoplerpoop".
050130			0.9.2	Removed two tag mismatches...
040716			0.9.2	Made some easy-to-edit defines to change how much each prize will cost you.
040715			0.9.1	As betting progresses, a red/blue hud message displays how much money was bet on each player, and how many bets each player got so far. Hudchannels can be tweaked.
040616			0.9		Added menu timer + cvar.
						Fixed another bug that made the bet menu not show properly when lastmanbets_overridemenus was not set. Sometimes VGUI menu was detected as open on a player,
						however the player did not have any menu at all open. VGUI menus are now always overridden.
040613			0.81	Fixed override cvar - looks like it worked the opposite way.
						* Note that a typo in the cvar name itself was corrected: lastmanbets_overridemenus <---
040612			0.8		Betting wouldn't work at all when prizes were disabled. :-)
040611			0.7		Moved around some code, it's possible now to compile it all without prizes by commenting a define.
						Can now also be compiled in debugmode. Debugmode should output (to server console) what players get the menu, and who doesn't and why they didn't.
						Possible bugfíx (didn't see the bug in action...): when someone respawns, it should now be impossible for the bettings to start because that player just died.
						Pot now saves to vault, so if it's not collected when map ends it will still be there for next map.
040607			0.6.1	Another try to fix the bug people are having with the menu never showing up (removed all uses of get_players)
040604			0.6		Bots supposedly didn't bet with lastmanbets_overridemenus set to 1. Fixed.
						Prizes added.
						Got some odd behaviour suddenly from a native (get_players) when bets were about to start, decided to scrap it and do things manually :-P.
040601			0.5		After round ended (bomb exploded, defused, hostages rescued etc), bets could still be started briefly if a 1vs1 situation appeared, ie
						if someone killed someone after round ended. Should be fixed.
						Other tweaks and bug fixes.
						Added two new options when betting for faster "wild" betting.
						Made cvar lastmanbets_defaultbet.
040531			0.4.2	Added lastmanbets_overridemenus cvar.
040530			0.4.1	If a user already has a menu open, no betting menu will open for that user.
040530			0.4		Bet menu should now close by itself when rounds end and you didn't place a bet fast enough.
040528			0.3		Added pot.
						Small bugfix, thx to Martel.
040518			0.2		At draw, it should pay any bet money back... (when do you get draws in CS btw?)
						A couple fixes here and there
						Bots do way cooler betting now.
040517			0.1		First version


TO DO
=====
-	bet against the odds
-	redo the now IMO somewhat ugly menu
-	verbose output of bets, prizes, stats..? Keep history, like top-ten most rewarding wins? Ever, and for current map...? (And output who killed who etc :-)
-	max time, like 20 seconds, to bet, else menu closes

	  - Johnny got his gun

// it can (ie until less than $1000 remains), then goes on to buy extra health, and then extra armour. With that said, make sure extra life is still the most expensive

// __________________Bot settings here (you don't need to touch these)__________________
// A bot can be a "gambler", betting on the person with the lowest sum of HP and armour, else he's playing it "safe". To become a gambler
// each bot needs to get a random value below a certain (individual) value. This value in turn is gotten by choosing a random value between BOTGAMBLERMIN and BOTGAMBLERMAX.
// Ie the bot gamble value could end up as 0.3, and then it's a 30% chance that the bot will bet on the weaker remaining player.
#define BOTGAMBLERMAX			0.4
