# Cs-1.6-COD-MW-Mod
Old repository for my AMXMODX source code. For Counter Strike 1.6, Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare mod.

Please note that i do not create the base mod. The base mod credit goes to QTM_Peyote on amxx.pl

Some of my old work file are missing ( Hard Drive issue ), and this repository only used to backup all of my old work files. This repository still a mess, there's still to many redundant file, double source, and etc.
